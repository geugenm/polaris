vinvelivaanilai - Solution for all your space-weather needs
===========================================================

Vinveli - Space, Vaanilai - Weather (in Tamil)

vinvelivaanilai is an open-source (LGPLv3) project which helps collect
space weather data from ftp.swpc.noaa.gov and TLEs/OMMs from celestrak.com
for your use! The aim is to retrieve the data and provide it as pandas
DataFrames enabling faster development for machine learning projects.

It is a part of the Polaris (an open-source Python3 tool to analyze a satellite
telemetry) which is a project under Libre Space Foundation.

Feel free to check out our `source code`_ and contribute to the project.
Also join us in our `Riot chatroom`_ for engaging AI in Space discussions.
